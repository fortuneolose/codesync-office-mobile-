# CodeSync Office Mobile

CodeSync Office Mobile is a focused React Native and TypeScript productivity app for reviewing notes, tasks, and documents from a notes API. It was built as a compact portfolio project that demonstrates mobile UI composition, typed API integration, offline fallback behavior, and unit-tested domain logic without hiding key decisions behind unnecessary framework complexity.

## Project Summary

The app presents an office-style workspace with:

- a searchable list of notes, tasks, and documents
- segmented filters by content type
- loading, offline, and error states
- local cache fallback using AsyncStorage
- a configurable API boundary for an existing notes service
- pure business logic covered by unit tests

The implementation is intentionally scoped to one polished workflow: open the app, sync workspace items, search or filter the list, and continue seeing useful cached content when the API cannot be reached.

## Screenshots

Add a current screenshot or short GIF of the Expo web preview here before sharing the repository publicly.

Suggested capture:

```bash
npm run web
```

Then capture the workspace screen showing the search bar, segmented filters, sync state, and item list.

## Key Skills Showcased

### React Native Application Development

The UI is built with React Native primitives and Expo. The screen is composed from small, focused components rather than a single large component:

- `App.tsx` wires together the page-level experience.
- `SearchToolbar` handles text search input.
- `FilterTabs` provides segmented note/task/document filtering.
- `StatePanel` renders loading, offline, and error feedback.
- `WorkspaceList` and `WorkspaceItemRow` render the productivity list.

This demonstrates component decomposition, responsive mobile layout, platform-friendly styling, and practical use of Expo for fast development.

### TypeScript Modeling

The app uses explicit TypeScript types for the core domain:

- `WorkspaceItem`
- `WorkspaceItemKind`
- `WorkspaceItemStatus`
- `WorkspaceFilter`
- `SyncState`
- `RemoteWorkspaceItem`

These types keep API payload handling, state transitions, and UI props clear. The project runs with strict TypeScript settings so missing or unsafe assumptions are caught early.

### API Integration Boundary

The API integration is isolated in `src/api/notesClient.ts`. Components do not call `fetch` directly and do not know about raw backend response shapes.

The app calls:

```text
GET {EXPO_PUBLIC_NOTES_API_URL}/notes
```

It accepts either a direct array:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "kind": "note",
    "title": "Meeting notes",
    "body": "Decision log",
    "status": "active",
    "tags": ["planning"],
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-18T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

or a wrapped response:

```json
{ "items": [] }
```

The normalizer also supports common alternate fields such as `type`, `content`, `text`, `updated_at`, and `due_at`. That makes the frontend adaptable to realistic API differences while keeping the rest of the app stable.

### Offline and Error Handling

The app uses a repository-style loader in `src/domain/workspaceRepository.ts`:

1. Try to load fresh items from the notes API.
2. Write successful responses to AsyncStorage.
3. If the API fails, read cached items.
4. If no cache exists, show a clear error state while keeping sample data visible.

This demonstrates graceful degradation and a realistic mobile-first approach where network access cannot be assumed.

### Search and Filtering Logic

Filtering is implemented as pure domain logic in `src/domain/filterItems.ts`. The search checks:

- title
- body
- status
- kind
- tags

Results are sorted newest-first by `updatedAt`. Keeping this logic outside React makes it simple to test and reuse.

### Unit Testing

Vitest tests cover the important non-visual behavior:

- filtering by item type
- full-text search
- newest-first sorting
- counts for segmented filters
- network success with cache write
- network success when cache write fails
- API failure with cached fallback
- API failure with empty fallback
- API failure when cache read also fails

The tests focus on the logic most likely to regress and avoid brittle snapshot testing for visual components.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the native Expo development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Run the browser preview:

```bash
npm run web
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run TypeScript verification:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

## Configuration

Set the notes API base URL before starting Expo.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:EXPO_PUBLIC_NOTES_API_URL="http://localhost:8000/api"
$env:EXPO_PUBLIC_NOTES_API_TOKEN="<optional bearer token>"
```

Bash:

```bash
export EXPO_PUBLIC_NOTES_API_URL="http://localhost:8000/api"
export EXPO_PUBLIC_NOTES_API_TOKEN="<optional bearer token>"
```

If no environment variable is provided, the app defaults to:

```text
http://localhost:8000/api
```

## State Management

The project uses local React state because the product scope is deliberately focused on a single workspace screen. `useWorkspaceItems` owns:

- fetched items
- active query
- active item type filter
- sync state
- last successful sync timestamp
- user-facing error message

This keeps state flow easy to inspect while still separating reusable logic into pure domain modules.

## Design Decisions

- Expo was chosen to reduce setup friction and make the project easy to run on mobile or web.
- Local React state was chosen over a global store because the current workflow does not need cross-screen coordination.
- AsyncStorage provides offline read support, but the app does not implement background sync, write queues, or conflict resolution.
- The API boundary is flexible enough for a real notes API, but the app intentionally does not include a backend implementation.
- Unit tests focus on core behavior rather than visual snapshots, which keeps the test suite stable and meaningful.

These choices keep the project small enough to explain in an interview while still showing practical cross-platform product engineering decisions: a typed API boundary, explicit offline fallback, isolated business logic, and CI-backed verification.

## Verification

Current checks used during development:

```bash
npx expo install --check
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

GitHub Actions runs `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` on pushes to `main` and pull requests.

Expected test coverage:

```text
2 test files
9 tests
```
